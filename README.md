Little project: A Wordle Solver

There are 8258 words of 5 letters in the English dictionary (at least on the file that I received during a course at the university) but only 2315 are allowed in the original version of the game.
I found all the words I use here on the website of the Departement of Mathematics of The University of Texas at Austin (https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/rusin/wordle/official).

I have added a **file called 'Wordle.txt'**, please **save it in the same folder as this notebook**.
